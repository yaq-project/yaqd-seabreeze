# Scripting for `seabreeze-script`

This folder contains example module(s) for the `seabreeze-script` daemon.
The scripts handle raw acquisitions generated by the seabreeze device to generate channels that can then be extracted through a client.

`seabreeze-script` modules are similar to yaqd-ni-daqmx-tmux scripts.
One difference is that these scripts explicitly declare the channels and some of their properties.
See example scripts for details.
